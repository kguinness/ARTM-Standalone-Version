# ARTM
Senior project using AR glasses for gesture bound macros.

Our project aims to create an app for the AR glasses created by Brilliant Labs Frame that recognizes preprogrammed hand gestures. These gestures will trigger user-defined macros, providing a seamless and hands-free interaction experience. The primary goal is to enhance convenience as AR glasses become more integrated into everyday life, particularly by offering an alternative to traditional input methods. This technology holds significant potential for improving accessibility for individuals who may have lost the dexterity to type but retain the ability to perform gestures. The project will explore how gesture-based interactions can contribute to the future of wearable technology, emphasizing both convenience and inclusivity.
